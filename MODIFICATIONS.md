## Important Notes

Kugou Music does not provide a stable public API for all personal music data.
This modification uses the saved login session and compatible web/mobile
endpoints when possible. If Kugou changes its service behavior, some playlists
may fail to load or some songs may not be playable.

Please do not use this project to infringe music platform copyrights or bypass
paid access restrictions.

## Web Adaptation Addendum

Beginning on 2026-07-13, this repository also contains an unofficial responsive
web adaptation with a separate LAN synchronization relay and restricted local
music adapter. The original copyright, GPL-3.0 license, attribution, design
notice, and acknowledgements above remain unchanged. Additional details are in
`ATTRIBUTION.md`.
